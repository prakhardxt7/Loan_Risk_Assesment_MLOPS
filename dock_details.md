Based on the folder structure and content provided in the images, here's a suitable Dockerfile for your FastAPI application:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python image as the base
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the main application files to the container
COPY main.py /app/
COPY prediction_model /app/prediction_model
COPY tests /app/tests

# Copy the requirements file to the container
COPY requirements.txt /app/

# Install necessary dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Expose the port that FastAPI will run on
EXPOSE 8000

# Start the FastAPI app using Uvicorn
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Explanation of the Dockerfile
1. **Base Image**: The `python:3.10-slim` is used as it is lightweight and sufficient for Python applications.
2. **Working Directory**: The working directory inside the container is set to `/app`.
3. **Copying Files**:
   - `main.py` is copied to `/app`.
   - The `prediction_model` directory (along with its contents) is copied to `/app/prediction_model`.
   - The `tests` directory is copied to `/app/tests`.
4. **Dependencies**: The `requirements.txt` file is used to install all the necessary Python dependencies.
5. **Expose Port**: Port `8000` is exposed to allow external access to the FastAPI app.
6. **Command**: The `CMD` command starts the FastAPI app using Uvicorn.
